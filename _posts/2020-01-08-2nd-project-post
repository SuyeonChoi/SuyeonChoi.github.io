Three Big Goals
1. maintaing network access 
2. fire at will
3. navigate robot to GPS
  
### Questions and some Answers  
+ fire at will
  - Does the robot actually going to fire a bomb? -No, I'll just make a noise.  
  - What is the performance of the available equipment?    
+ navigate robot to GPS  
  - Is the map of the test field given to us?  
  - What kind of environment is given? Mountain or flat? -Flat place for start.  
  - What obstacles should be considered?  
  - Need to cover up the robot?  
  - Is GPS given within reach?  
  - Is there one robot in the test environment?  
  - Should commands be entered into the robot at once or sequentially?  -This should be considered in terms of direct performance.  

### More details about the Q&A  
  - Should commands be entered into the robot at once or sequentially?  -This should be considered in terms of direct performance.  
  Think a robot as a human. Telling the final location would be more convenient than telling the next destination in sequence. 
  But where security is high, it may be another problem.
    
### This Week final Goal
Let the robot go to the GPS location we want in a flat, clear space.  
Consideration  
1. getting gps point
2. calculate error
3. navigating next
