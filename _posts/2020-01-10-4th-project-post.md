For the foundation of the project, four people, besides Jihye and I, agreed to join forces.  
We got three things to do before starting our real software project.  
1.	GPS on Raspberry pi
2.	Network
3.	Robot movement - Using ROS

Jiyhe and I choose the Robot movement with two other people.  
We're installing the ROS on Ubuntu for now on.
