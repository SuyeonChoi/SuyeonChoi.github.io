first, our project topic was **"Agriculture in IoT"** and detail topic was **"improved Energy Monitoring and Analytics"**.  
Professor said that students whose project topic is "Ag IoT" should make a presentation about their detail topic.  
So we made it.

(This picture is a cover of our ppt.)    

But, we changed our project topic to **"Targeting AI Robot"**.  
There was a two reasons :  
  1. There were a lot of Students who chose "Ag IoT" (20 students). So we thought we'll not have sufficient mentors' assistance.  
  1. After listening about "Targeting AI Robot", we were interested.    
  
Now our project topic is "Targeting AI Robot".  
Unfortunately, we don't have sufficient data about it because this topic is new topic.  
But we will get a lot of data and information about it because there are many mentors.    

After we made a definite decision, we made a poster about our team.

We think we made it very well!  
Making this poster was so hard but it was so funny!    

We will hear detailed explaination about "Targeting AI Robot".
We expect this project goes well.
