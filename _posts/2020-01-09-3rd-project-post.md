All the people whose project topic is "Targeting AI Robot", including our team, didn't know exactly about this topic.  
Because we only know about blueprint of this topic.  
Professor and a company which give us this topic didn't let us know exactly.  
So we had many meeting with people whose project topic is same with us(sometimes, with mentors).    

As a result, we received an assignment.  
This assignment is reading many documents concerned with this topic.  
So we read them, but in fact we didn't like method of progress of this project.  
We talked this to our mentors, and in conclusion we decided we have a meeting tomorrow with professor and mentors.    

And mentors said that we'd like to think about what we want to do.  
(for example, what is a detailed topic we want)  
So we thought about this, reading many documents.
